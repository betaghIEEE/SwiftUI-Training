This is supposed to be a directory for SwiftUI App Africa.  Does this work.


So I will begin with analysis of this lesson from the SwiftUI Master Class, in particular the SwiftUI App Africa.  
There are many features can prove handy for applications that I might consider.  So let us look at the pro's and con's.

Pros:

*   This class discusses the use AVPlayer
*   This class discusses the use of ReST and network access to metadata (that can include DNS and other records of the AV resources)
*   The ReST and JSON data could also have other data useful for making a powerful app for our clients.

Con's:

*   Does the AV Player have the codec for the stream we are working with?  

    **  If not, this course only gets you to one of the "Get Smart" doors.

    **  You have some doors yet to go through.

*   This course does not provide the Swift Objects training to build the ReST part.

    **  This isn't so bad as I might provide such a course at later time.

    **  There are other technologies that can also provide the back end.

So what does this Africa with JSON Data provide in terms of lessons learned?
